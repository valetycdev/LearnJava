# Learn Java
Im an CS student and I want to learn Java, so I created this repo.
The idea is to understand how the language works and how to use it.
I mean the sintaxis is very different from other languages, such as python. In addition, is very important
for me to learn very well the sintaxis of the language.
As I learn more, I will add pdf files with information and drawings
that can be used to learn Java.

If you want to read Java Documentation, you can visit their official site:

Hope you enjoy it!
